Hey! I'm Jorge Facundo Alegre, a software engineer specialized in iOS development.

## Early years

I was born in CÃ³rdoba, Argentina, but I spent 5 years when I was kid in Los
Angeles, California. I was lucky enough to spend key years of my childhood
growing up in a different country, learn English as a native speaker and spend
a lot of time watching my dad work in construction, something I learned a lot
from.
